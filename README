SYNOPSIS
     use Array::Find qw(find_in_array);
     use Data::Dump;

     dd find_in_array(
         items      => [qw/a x/],

         max_result => 2,
     ); # ['a', 'a']

     # find by prefix (or suffix, with/without word separator), in multiple arrays
     dd find_in_array(
         item       => 'a.b',
         mode       => 'prefix',
         word_sep   => '.',
         arrays     => [
             [qw/a a.b. a.b a.bb/],

     ); # ['a.b.', 'a.b', 'a.b.c']

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides one subroutine: "find_in_array" to find items in
    array.

    This module uses Sub::Spec framework, which means you can switch from
    named arguments to positional, apply execution time limits, run the
    subroutine from the command line, etc. Refer to Sub::Spec documentation
    for more details.

FUNCTIONS
    None of the functions are exported by default, but they are exportable.

  find_in_array(%args) -> RESULT
    Find items in array, with several options.

    find_in_array looks for one or more items in one or more arrays and
    return an array containing all or some results (empty arrayref if no
    results found). You can specify several options, like maximum number of
    results, maximum number of comparisons, searching by suffix/prefix, case
    sensitivity, etc. Consult the list of arguments for more details.

    Currently, items are compared using the Perl's eq operator, meaning they
    only work with scalars and compare things asciibetically.

    Arguments ("*" denotes required arguments):

    *   item => *str*

        Item to find.

        Currently can only be scalar. See also 'items' if you want to find
        several items at once.

    *   array => *array*

        Array to find items in.

        See also 'arrays' if you want to find in several arrays. Array
        elements can be undef and will only match undef.

    *   arrays => *array*

        Just like 'array', except several.

        Use this to find several items at once.

        Example: find_in_array(item => "a", arrays => [["b", "a"], ["c",
        "a"]]) will return result ["a", "a"].

    *   ci => *bool* (default 0)

        Set case insensitive.

    *   items => *array*

        Just like 'item', except several.

        Use this to find several items at once. Elements can be undef if you
        want to search for undef.

        Example: find_in_array(items => ["a", "b"], array => ["b", "a", "c",
        "a"]) will return result ["b", "a", "a"].

    *   max_compare => *int*

        Set maximum number of comparison.

        Maximum number of elements in array(s) to look for, 0 means
        unlimited. Finding will stop as soon as this limit is reached,
        regardless of max_result. Example: find(item=>'a', array=>['q', 'w',
        'e', 'a'], max_compare=>3) will not return result.

    *   max_result => *int*

        Set maximum number of results.

        0 means unlimited (find in all elements of all arrays).

        +N means find until results have N items. Example:
        find_in_array(item=>'a', array=>['a', 'b', 'a', 'a'], max_result=>2)
        will return result ['a', 'a'].

        -N is useful when looking for multiple items (see 'items' argument).
        It means find until N items to look for have been found. Example:
        find_in_array(items=>['a','b'], array=>['a', 'a', 'b', 'b'],
        max_results=>-2) will return result ['a', 'a', 'b']. As soon as 2
        items to look for have been found it will stop.

    *   mode => *str* (default "exact")

        Value must be one of:

         [
           "exact",
           "prefix",
           "suffix",
           "infix",
           "prefix|infix",
           "prefix|suffix",
           "prefix|infix|suffix",
           "infix|suffix",
           "regex",
         ]

        Comparison mode.

        Exact match is the default, will only match 'ap' with 'ap'. Prefix
        matching will also match 'ap' with 'ap', 'apple', and 'apricot'.
        Suffix matching will match 'le' with 'le' and 'apple'. Infix will
        only match 'ap' with 'claps' and not with 'ap', 'clap', or 'apple'.
        Regex will regard item as a regex and perform a regex match on each
        element of array.

        See also 'word_sep' which affects prefix/suffix/infix matching.

    *   shuffle => *bool*

        Shuffle result.

    *   word_sep => *str*

        Aliases: ws

        Define word separator.

        If set, item and array element will be regarded as a separated
        words. This will affect prefix/suffix/infix matching. Example, with
        '.' as the word separator and 'a.b' as the item, prefix matching
        will 'a.b', 'a.b.', and 'a.b.c' (but not 'a.bc'). Suffix matching
        will match 'a.b', '.a.b', 'c.a.b' (but not 'ca.b'). Infix matching
        will match 'c.a.b.c' and won't match 'a.b', 'a.b.c', or 'c.a.b'.
